# Free 2D Fantasy MMORPG Assets
A complete collection of sprites, tilesets, animations, interface elements, sounds, music, tools and more for creating free 2d mmorpgs using the Intersect game engine.

This pack originated when [George at AGD](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/20-george/) released his [16x16 game assets](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/topic/742-16x16-custom-assets/). Shortly after, [PixelFox at AGD](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/264-pixelfox/) released some [sprites, animations, and more](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/topic/740-small-fantasy-resources/) that all fit together extremely well. A short fundraiser was held at AGD and we were able to commission more tiles, characters, and much more from [Zetasis](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/13-zetasis/) and [Murdoc](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/3-xenogene/).

We continued by commissioning a UI design from [Aesthetic at AGD](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/377-aesthetic/) and then proceeded to locate items, animations, sounds, and music with loose licensing restrictions from across the net. 

All of the assets in this pack are free to use legally in your projects, even commercially. Please see the licensing information below for more information.

### Animations & More


## Contributing
We'd love to expand this pack with more assets! Please feel free to contribute assets to this repo via a PR or reaching out to [jcsnider](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/1-jcsnider/) via AGD.  We have an [ongoing wishlist here](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Assets/issues/1) if you are looking for ideas.


## Acknowledgements
We cannot thank George, PixelFox, Zetasis, Murdoc, Aesthetic, and everyone else who contributed to this pack enough. Your hard work made all of this possible! Thanks again!

Also want to add a quick special thanks to Khaikaa for helping me with some of the naming and organization of these assets.

## Complementary Assets
This pack doesn't include fogs at this time. (They're on our wishlist!) But [here](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/topic/3761-found-some-fogs/) is a good set that I found that would work great in non-commercial projects. The original author never specified any sort of license so these will not be included in this pack by default.
